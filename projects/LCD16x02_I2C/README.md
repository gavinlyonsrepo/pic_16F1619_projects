Features
----------------------


Display the value of an analog input (10-bit ADC value(0-1023)) of a PIC pin
on a LCD 16x02. The ADC value is converted to voltage value .
(It assumes vdd  = 5V) which maps 0-1023 to 0-5V ranges.

The 10-bit ADC (0 to 1023) value is read from a pot attached to PIC pin RA4(PORT A)
It is then displayed on the display.
The value is read on a interrupt generated by overflow of timer0 every 2.4 second.
A status LED on RA2 toggles on same Timer.

In this folder the main source code in C for program can be found in file main.c
The code  generated using the MPLAB Code Configurator (MCC) tool is  
in a folder called mcc_generated_files.

1. RA4 = Analog data in.
2. RA2 = Status LED.

**HD44780-based character LCD**

HD44780 based character LCD displays use 14 wire connections: 8 data lines (D0-D7), 3 control lines (RS, E, R/W), and three power lines (Vdd, Vss, Vee). Some LCDs come with backlight features that help reading display data in low illumination conditions. They have two additional connections (LED+ and LED- or A and K).

In this example code, a 4-pin PCF8574 Interface "backpack" board is attached to LCD. It is controlled via the two pin I2C bus. Both pins must be held logic high by pull-up resistors. 

1. RB4 = SDA
2. RB6 = SCLK 

The LCD read-out refreshed every 2.4 seconds on Timer0 overflow.
The LCD code is in a separate library called "lcd,h".
The Data is sent in 4-bit mode. The upper nibble holds the data and lower nibble of byte manipulates
the control bits of LCD(enable and register select).
