Overview
--------------------------------------------
* Name: OLED_I2C
* Description: Custom character(text only)  based  library for
a OLED display 128 by 32 pixels  with SSD1306 via the I2C bus. Code should also work 
with a 128 by 64 display by commenting in/out small block of code in library file.
This exmaple here displays an analog input on OLED.
* Author: Gavin Lyons.
* Complier: xc8 v2.00 compiler
* Foundation services library: 0.1.31 (I2C)
* MCC version: 3.75
* PIC: PIC16F1619 
* IDE:  MPLAB X v5.00

Features
----------------------

In this folder the main source code in C for program can be found in file main.c
The code generated using the MPLAB Code Configurator (MCC) tool is  
in a folder called mcc_generated_files. There is also an Oled library(OLED.c and OLED.h)
and a font.h file that contains an ASCII pixelfont.

**Analog input** 
To demonstrate the library an analog input (10-bit ADC value(0-1023)) of a PIC pin is displayed
on the OLED. The ADC value is converted to voltage value .
(It assumes vdd  = 5V) which maps 0-1023 to 0-5V ranges.

The 10-bit ADC (0 to 1023) value is read from a pot attached to PIC pin RA4(PORT A)
The value is read on a interrupt generated by overflow of timer0 every 2.4 seconds
A status LED on RA2 toggles on same Timer.

1. RA4 = Analog data in.
2. RA2 = Status LED.

**OLED 128 by 32 SSD1306**

SSD1306 is a single-chip CMOS OLED/PLED driver with controller for organic / polymer light emitting diode  dot-matrix  graphic  display  system.  It  consists  of  128 segments and 64 commons.  This  IC  is  designed for Common Cathode type OLED panel. The  SSD1306  embeds  with  contrast  control,  display  RAM  and  oscillator,  which  reduces  the  number  of  external  components  and  power  consumption.  It  has  256-step  brightness  control.  Data/Commands  are  sent from general MCU through the hardware selectable 6800/8000 series compatible Parallel Interface, I2C interface or Serial Peripheral Interface.

The SSD1306 OLED display communicates with the master device over I2C mode.
 It is controlled via the two pin I2C bus. Both pins must be held logic high by pull-up resistors. 

1. RB4 = SDA
2. RB6 = SCLK 

The OLED read-out is refreshed every 2.4 seconds on the Timer0 overflow.
The OLED code is in a separate library called "OLED.h".

The ASCII based font file is a called "font.h". Each character is printed in a 5 by 8 box pixel.
(width by height) with a another blank byte printed in between so a box of 48 pixels in total for each character.
The screen is 128 by 32 pixels. So (32/8) 4 rows available and (128/6) 21 columns available.
The screen is divided into 8 byte pages(rows or lines). 
4 rows/lines (128 by 32) are available by changing page value.

This library turns the OLED into a character 21x04 based screen.
A total of 84 characters. There are no graphics in library and one font. 
Bear in mind this PIC has limited memory. Data space is 1K and program space 8k.
This example program is already at 50% of program space and 20% of data space.

**OLED 128 by 64 SSD1306**

It will also work on a OLED 128 by 64 SSD1306,
as well with one modification to library( comment in/out a block of marked code at top of oled.h)
