Features
----------------------


The Data is read on a interrupt generated by overflow of timer0
every ~4  seconds.

The DHT11 is connected to RC4.
The DHT returns temperature and humidity readings (ranges 0-50'C and 20-90% respectively.) . 
The digits of the temperature are displayed on left hand side of LED module and
 the digits of the humidity on right hand side. 
 i.e. if the sensor is reported 25'C and 49% humidity the Display reads 2549.
A status LED on RA2 toggles on same Timer.

4 pins of PORT B controls the four cathodes of each digit.

3 pins of PORT C of PIC outputs the data to a 74HC595 shift register which in 
turn is connected to anodes of the SMA420564 common cathode display LED module.

In this folder the main source code in C for program can be found in file main.c
The code  generated using the MPLAB Code Configurator (MCC) tool is  
 in folder called mcc_generated_files

MPLAB Code Configurator (MCC) is a free, graphical programming environment that generates ,
C code to be inserted into your project. It is built in to the MPLAB IDE
Using an interface, it enables and configures a rich set of 
peripherals and functions specific to the application.

RC4 = Analog In.
RA2 = Status LED.

Error codes

1. 7 = Communication Start-up Error. The Program has hanged up while trying to communicate
2. 8 = Communications Error. No response to the PICs request signal from sensor.
3. 9 = Checksum Error. Received all data from sensor but it failed checksum.

Communication Format with DHT11 can be separated into three stages.

    Request
    Response
    Data Reading 5 bytes.
    Sum the 1st 4 bytes and check if the result is the same as CheckSum(5th byte)

NOTE: For schematic the pin NUMBER labels on 4-digit 7-segment are different: 
(I used library footprint of a slightly different module)
Use the pin numbers in table above.
or just use the pin NAME(letter) labels on part which are correct.
