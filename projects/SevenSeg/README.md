Features
----------------------

Display the value of an analog input (10-bit ADC value(0-1023)) of PIC pin,
on a 4 digit seven segment display. The ADC is converted to voltage.
(It assumes vdd  = 5V) which maps 0-1023 to 0-5V ranges. So will look like 3-02 
for 3.02V.

The 10-bit ADC (0 to 1023) value is read from a pot attached to PIC pin RA4(PORT A)
It is then displayed on the 4-digit seven segment display.
The value is read on a interrupt generated by overflow of timer0 every second.
So display will change once every second.
A status LED on RA2 toggles on same Timer.

4 pins of PORT B controls the four cathodes of each digit.

3 pins of PORT C of PIC outputs the data to a 74HC595 shift register which in 
turn is connected to anodes of the SMA420564 common cathode display LED module.

In this folder the main source code in C for program can be found in file main.c
The code  generated using the MPLAB Code Configurator (MCC) tool is  
 in folder called mcc_generated_files

MPLAB Code Configurator (MCC) is a free, graphical programming environment that generates ,
C code to be inserted into your project. It is built in to the MPLAB IDE
Using an interface, it enables and configures a rich set of 
peripherals and functions specific to the application.

RA4 = Analog In.
RA2 = Status LED.

NOTE: For schematic the pin NUMBER labels on 4-digit 7-segment are different: 
(I used library footprint of a slightly different module)
Use the pin numbers in table above.
or just use the pin NAME(letter) labels on part which are correct.
