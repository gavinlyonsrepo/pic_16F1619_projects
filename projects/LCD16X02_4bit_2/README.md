without using shift register. 6 GPIO pins.
* Author: Gavin Lyons.
* Complier: xc8 v2.05 compiler
* PIC: PIC16F1619 
* IDE:  MPLAB X v5.15

Features
----------------------

For demonstration of library we display the value of an analog input (10-bit ADC value(0-1023)) of a PIC pin
on a LCD 16x02. The value is read on a interrupt generated by overflow of timer0 every two seconds.
So display will change once every two seconds.
A status LED on RA2 toggles on same Timer.

1. RA4 = Analog data in.
2. RA2 = Status LED.

HD44780 based character LCD displays use 14 wire connections: 8 data lines (D0-D7), 3 control lines (RS, E, R/W), and three power lines (Vdd, Vss, Vee). Some LCDs come with backlight features that help reading display data in low illumination conditions. They have two additional connections (LED+ and LED- or A and K).

The control pin RS determines if the data transfer between the LCD module and an external microcontroller are actual character data or command/status. The enable pin (E) initiates the actual data transfer. When writing to the LCD display, the data is transferred only on the high to low transition of the E pin.

Read/Write(RW): This signal is used to write the data/cmd to LCD and reads the busy flag of LCD. For write operation the RW should be LOW and for read operation the R/W should be HIGH. 
Note: in this library I am not using the r/w line i tie it to ground, it is not needed in most applications in my experience.

The Vdd pin (2) should be connected to the positive power supply and Vss (1) to ground. Pin 3 (Vo or Vee) is for display contrast adjustment.

Pins 7 to 14 are data lines (D0-D7). Data transfer to and from the display can be achieved either in 8-bit or 4-bit mode. The 8-bit mode uses all eight data lines to transfer a byte, whereas, in 4-bit mode, a byte is transferred as two 4-bit nibbles. In the later case, only the upper 4 data lines (D4-D7) are used. This technique is beneficial as this saves some input/output pins of microcontroller. This example uses 4-bit mode.
