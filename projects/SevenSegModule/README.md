Overview
--------------------------------------------
* Name: SevenSegModule
* Description: Display an analog input 
on a 4-Digit 7 Segment Display 74HC595 module
* Author: Gavin Lyons.

Features
----------------------

The 10-bit ADC (0 to 1023) value is read from a pot attached to PIC pin RA4(PORT A)
The ADC input is converted to a voltage Value.
(It assumes vdd  = 5V) which maps 0-1023 to 0-5V ranges. So will look like 3-02 
for 3.02V. The value is read on a interrupt generated by overflow of timer0 every second.
A status LED on RA2 toggles on same Timer.

RA4 = Analog In.
RA2 = Status LED.

*4 digit 74HC595 module*

These modules have 5 pins, 3 data lines + power. They have a common anode
4 digit seven segment display(3461BS) and two 74HC595 shift registers.
Manufacture of module is HIFEI.

3 pins are connected from PORT C of PIC to the data lines of the 74HC595 module.
These modules are widely available, also you can easily build your own as per schematic. 
They have two shift registers daisy chained together which allows user to 
control a 4 digit seven segment display with just THREE GPIO pins.

The data must be sent in two bytes , first byte of data to display data on segment,
second byte controls which digit to write to(D1, D2, D3, D4). 
The display uses 3461BS, common anode, seven segment, 4-digit.
So data must be inverted(from common cathode) so 0x3F becomes 0xC0 for a Zero symbol.

(dp)gfedcba where dp is decimal point.
or more info on segments lettering  of seven segment display, see here.

To display zero with decimal point off. 

| Data Hex | Data bin (dp)gfedcba | 
| --- | --- |
| 0x3F (common cathode) | 0b00111111 |
| 0xC0 (common anode) |   0b11000000 |

Also data must be sent in MSB first to this module.
