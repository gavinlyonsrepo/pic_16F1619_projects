Features
----------------------

This library is a fork of the Arduino library ATMega328 by "avishorp".
I forked it then converted it from C++ to C and modified it for PIC micro-controller.

In the main.c file a series of tests is carried out showing library function.
A status LED on RA2 toggles on Timer after each test in main.c
Read on a interrupt generated by overflow of timer0.

RA2 = Status LED.

*TM1637*

These modules have 4 pins, 2 control lines(data and clock) + power. They have a 
4 digit seven segment display(3462BS) and a tm1637 control chip.
These modules are widely available. 
2 pins are connected from PORT B of PIC to the data and clock line of the module.
Thus allowing control of a 4 digit seven segment module with just two GPIO lines.

GPIO function on PIC, 2 lines to Tm1637 Module.
