Features
----------------------

Display data to a LCD 16x02 in 8-bit mode takes 11 GPIO pins. 

RA2 = Status LED.

**HD44780-based character LCD**

HD44780 based character LCD displays use 14 wire connections: 8 data lines (D0-D7), 3 control lines (RS, E, R/W), and three power lines (Vdd, Vss, Vee). Some LCDs come with backlight features that help reading display data in low illumination conditions. They have two additional connections (LED+ and LED- or A and K).

The control pin RS determines if the data transfer between the LCD module and an external microcontroller are actual character data or command/status. The enable pin (E) initiates the actual data transfer. When writing to the LCD display, the data is transferred only on the high to low transition of the E pin.
Read/Write(RW): This signal is used to write the data/cmd to LCD and reads the busy flag of LCD. For write operation the RW should be LOW and for read operation the R/W should be HIGH.

The Vdd pin (2) should be connected to the positive power supply and Vss (1) to ground. Pin 3 (Vee) is for display contrast adjustment.

Pins 7 to 14 are data lines (D0-D7). Data transfer to and from the display can be achieved either in 8-bit or 4-bit mode. The 8-bit mode uses all eight data lines to transfer a byte, whereas, in 4-bit mode, a byte is transferred as two 4-bit nibbles. In the later case, only the upper 4 data lines (D4-D7) are used. This design uses 8-bit. The LCD library will also support other sizes eg 20x04.
